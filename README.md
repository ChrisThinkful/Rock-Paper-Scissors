# Warrior Wizard Ranger

This is a reimagining of a favorite childhood game. Rather than choose between Rock, Paper or Scissors, you instead choose a fantasy combat style! Choose between the mighty warrior, the powerful wizard, or the cunning ranger

## Current and future iterations

In its current stage, you can play endlessly. The user's score and the computer's score, as well as their hero choice, can be seen below the hero choice section. Additionally, a statement can be found beneath hero choice telling the user if he/or won or lost.

In the next iteration, I will be adding a text field to decide how many rounds to play. Upon completion of the number of rounds entered by the user, an alert of some sort will inform the user that the game has ended and they will be prompted to try again.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to further develop my skills as a Web Developer by revisiting the foundations: CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 

The biggest takeaways so far from this project at its current stage is DOM Manipulation. While my skills with the DOM are still a work in progress, this project is a big step in the right direction.
