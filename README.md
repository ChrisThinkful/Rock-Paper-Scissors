# Rock Paper Scissors

 This is a simple implementation of a grade-school classic.

## Current and future iterations

The file index.html currently houses a **console** version of Rock Paper Scissors. In future updates, this index.html will be renamed to index-old.html. 

The next iteration of this project will be a fair bit more involved and take place **on** the webpage, as well as being much more viewer-friendly. 

### Playing in the console

Inside your browsers Dev Tools, access the console.

Once in the console, type game() and input an integer inside the parentheses. This interger will represent the number of rounds to be played.

For each round, you, the user, will be prompted to reply with either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. At this time, the code is case-sensitive so please capitalize your answer. 

Following each round, you will be told if you've won or lost, and be provided with your choice and the computer's.

At the completion of the round, win or loss statement will be printed to the console along with how many wins and ties you managed.


### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to further develop my skills as a Web Developer by revisiting the foundations: CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
